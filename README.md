As part of the practical project for the Computer Vision sprint, a dataset containing photos of people and their real age will be analyzed. Subsequently, a new dataset will be generated from which the model will be trained. As part of the neural network architecture, ResNet with 50 convolutional layers and one full-link layer with ReLU activation neuron and Adam optimizer with learning_rate equal to 0.0001 will be used. The goal of the project is to build a model with a MAE < 8.
